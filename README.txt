Perpetua Backend API Challenge 2021:

Getting Started:
This is an example of how to get this project running! 
1. Installations: npm i
2. (Optional) Make .env file with PORT 
3. Run server: npm run dev
4. Run tests: npm test

Overview and Future Plans:
This backend server was created using express and nodejs, using mocha chai for creating unit tests.
Implemented middleware to validate user input before running the controllers on the request, 
as well as defining error types
In the future, this can be expanded to contain cache, verifying user token, etc...
Structured this project to be an MVC model, so in the future if we want to implement databases, 
this structure can be expandable!
